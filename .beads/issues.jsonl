Sorting Logic: Implemented case-insensitive sorting in AttendeeDao (COLLATE NOCASE) and MainListViewModel.\n2. Sort Modes: Added NAME_ASC and RECENT_UPDATED (renamed from RECENT_PRESENT).\n3. UI: Added 'Sort By' menu to MainListScreen and removed 'Text Size'.\n4. Failures: Tests are failing due to constructor mismatches in AttendanceRecord/Event and WorkManager mocking issues in MainListViewModelTest.\n\nReasoning:\nFunctional changes are verified in-app, but tests were not updated to match recent architectural changes (Context requirement in ViewModel, entity field changes).\n\nProposed Direction:\n1. Update all AttendanceRecord/Event constructor calls in tests.\n2. Resolve WorkManager/SharedPreferences mocking in MainListViewModelTest.\n3. Fix SortMode imports and type inference in tests.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"matthewchng@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T06:54:43Z","created_by":"Matthew Chng","updated_at":"2026-02-24T07:26:17Z","closed_at":"2026-02-24T07:26:17Z","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["bug","testing"]}
